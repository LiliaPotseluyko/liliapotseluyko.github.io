      <h2>About</h2>
<p>Alongside my technical and research work, I have consistently taken on a leadership role in training and knowledge transfer. After developing new workflows and tools — particularly in Unreal Engine and 3D simulation — I create clear documentation and deliver practical training to colleagues and collaborators. In Cambridge, I have contributed to several visualisation-focused projects by supporting teams with onboarding and implementation guidance. I led a mobile mapping research group where we held regular knowledge exchange sessions, and I’ve delivered workshops on working with reality data for fellow researchers. I enjoy translating complex technical ideas into accessible formats, enabling others to build confidently on cutting-edge tools and methods.</p>
