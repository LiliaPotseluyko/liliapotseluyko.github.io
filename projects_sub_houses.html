      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>My PhD research, conducted in collaboration with <span class="highlight">Norscot</span> as part of a <span class="highlight">Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)</span> and supervised by <span class="highlight">Prof. Farzad Rahimian</span>, explored integrating Building Information Modelling (BIM), Virtual Reality (VR), and gamification to enhance design processes and communication within the <span class="highlight">Timber Frame Self-Build Housing Sector (TFSBS)</span>. The work focused on creating interactive, game-like environments that empower Norscot’s clients and small construction firms to visualise, configure, and engage with sustainable housing projects.</p>

      <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop an interactive VR-based house configurator integrating BIM data for design automation and customisation.</li>
          <li>Bridge the “black box” effect in BIM by exposing metadata and enabling real-time interaction with building components and cost information.</li>
          <li>Facilitate collaboration between clients, designers, and manufacturers through immersive experiences that simplify complex construction processes.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed VR prototypes such as <span class="highlight">Nisbet</span> and <span class="highlight">Souter</span>, which improved spatial awareness for Norscot’s clients, saved clients £5,500, and contributed to winning a £53,000 project.</li>
          <li>Developed a dynamic house configurator in Unreal Engine 4, integrating Revit BIM data and advanced scripting to support automated workflows and price calculation for Norscot’s design team.</li>
          <li>Presented at major conferences (CIB78, Digital Construction Week) and published in Automation in Construction, contributing to knowledge transfer between academia and industry.</li>
          <li>Generated annual labour cost savings of approximately <span class="highlight">£70,000</span> for Norscot by developing in-house VR/BIM expertise rather than outsourcing.</li>
          <li>Received the <span class="highlight">"Innovator of the Future" Commendation</span> at the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Awards 2020, recognising exceptional contributions to innovation.</li>
          <li>Awarded an <span class="highlight">Outstanding KTP Grade</span>, the highest possible rating, for the successful project delivery, impact, and innovation.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Prototypes & Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Utilised Autodesk Revit and Unreal Engine 4 with Blueprints and C++ scripting to develop interactive configurators featuring:
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic teleport menus and object manipulation.</li>
          <li>Real-time metadata extraction and integration.</li>
          <li>Automated cost calculations and design scenario testing.</li>
          <li>Multi-user collaboration and immersive VR walkthroughs.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Final Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        This research delivered a novel XR-BIM integration framework for <span class="highlight">Norscot</span> that enhances client decision-making and reduces design iterations. Conducted as part of a <span class="highlight">KTP</span> and supervised by <span class="highlight">Prof. Farzad Rahimian</span>, it also strengthened my project management, research methodology, and communication skills through extensive industry engagement and knowledge dissemination. I look forward to applying these insights to future digital twin projects and supporting sustainable construction practices with Norscot and beyond.
