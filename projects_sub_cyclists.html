      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project, carried out in collaboration with Khashayar Kazemzadeh, analyzes cyclists’ experiences in pedestrian-shared spaces and on-road lanes shared with motor vehicles. To empower stakeholders with consistent and comparable insights into different road environments, we created 24 animated video scenarios (VRE Scenarios) using Unreal Engine. This approach enables stakeholders to systematically evaluate factors like pavement distress, lighting quality, and crowd density—conditions that would be challenging to test reliably using real-world videos alone. These insights will help the Department of Transport make more informed decisions on improving cycling infrastructure.
      </p>
      <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify infrastructure factors that negatively impact the cycling experience</li>
        <li>Assess the importance of these factors for underrepresented groups</li>
        <li>Develop a metric for planners to evaluate cycling facilities from a user-centred perspective</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>VRE Scenario Development</h2>
      <p>
        The VRE scenarios were built using 3D BIM data from the Department of Transport, imported into 3ds Max for segmentation, and then exported to Unreal Engine. We refined the assets by adding realistic details such as potholes, lighting, traffic signs, and urban clutter. Unreal Engine’s modeling tools and Quixel Megascans materials were used to enhance realism. This process allowed us to create immersive video scenarios under various conditions including day/night, traffic density, and pedestrian presence.

      <h2>Simulation Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        Each VRE scenario tests different conditions: pavement quality, lighting, vehicle and pedestrian density, and presence of CCTV. Videos were recorded from these scenarios to be used in survey-based experiments. Not all 24 videos will be displayed on this portfolio; instead, we include a selection of 2–4 example scenarios to illustrate the range of conditions.

      <h2>Data Collection & Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Over <strong>4,000</strong> survey responses were collected in London, Cambridge, and Oxford. While Khashayar Kazemzadeh led the data analysis, I worked closely with him to ensure the videos met the standards discussed with project stakeholders. This collaborative effort ensured that the visual materials aligned with the research objectives and survey requirements. We worked on tight deadlines, ensuring the project was completed within just six weeks.

      <h2>Ongoing Work</h2>
      <p>
        The project is still in progress. We are continuing to analyze the survey data and refine the VRE scenarios. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how cyclists react to different road environments, ultimately supporting better infrastructure decisions by the Department of Transport.
