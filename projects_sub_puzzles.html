  <strong>Digital Roads of the Future</strong><br>
  <em>Project Partners:</em> Costain, National Highways, University of Cambridge<br>
  <em>Project Dates:</em> April 2022 – March 2027<br><br>
  As part of a large, multi-disciplinary team delivering a national-scale digital twin initiative
   for National Highways, 
   I contributed to integrating the many complex “puzzle pieces” into a coherent pruduct. 
   Our team combined expertise across construction engineering, robotics, data science,
    and smart materials — every step demanded tight collaboration and technical agility
     across disciplines.

      <h2>Dataset preparation contribution</h2>
<p>
  I played a key role in preparing the datasets for the digital twin, 
  ensuring they were ready for integration into the larger system.
  <br><br>

  <strong>Dataset Preparation:</strong> 
  Processed datasets for the A14, A12, and A11 roads in the UK — including 
  point clouds, 360° and pavement images. This included segmenting 
  traffic sign meshes and generating textured assets using a hybrid workflow. 
  I also created both VR and desktop demos that combined multiple data outputs.
  <br><br>

  Through this work, I learned how industry-standard tools used to process similar data, 
  including <em>Trimble Business Center, TopoDOT, CloudCompare, Orbit 3DM, 
  RealityCapture,</em> and <em>QGIS</em>.

      <h2>Proceedural Model Development</h2>
      <p>
        I developed procedural models to generate realistic road environments, 
        including road signs, barriers, pavement and other assets. This work was crucial 
        for creating a dynamic and immersive digital twin experience.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Procedural Models:</strong> 
        I used Unreal Engine Geometry Scripting and PCG(procedural content generation) tools to deleveop textured 3D Models of road assets. 
        This allowed for rapid generation of realistic 
        environments that could be easily updated as new data became available.

      <h2>Digital Twin  Updating Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Co-developed communication protocols between Unreal Engine
         and the geospatial backend (PostgreSQL + Flask) to dynamically stream 
         location-based point clouds and meshes into Unreal Engine.
