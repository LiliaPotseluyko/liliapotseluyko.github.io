      <h2>Enhancing Road Digital Twins With Adaptive 3D Pavement Model</h2>
      <p>This paper is about enhancing road Digital Twins (DTs) with high-fidelity 3D pavement mesh reconstruction.
         this paper addresses the lack of contextualized information by presenting a semi-automatic workflow
          for enhancing road Digital Twins with dynamically adaptive pavement textured meshes.
        <strong> Publication status:</strong> Development Completed, Writing in Progress. <strong>Co-authors:</strong> Leonardo Binni, Varun Kumar Reja, Tom Kelly, Hamidreza Alavi</p>

      <h2>Enhancing Road Digital Twins with High-Fidelity 3D Traffic Sign Reconstruction</h2>
      <p>The study addresses the critical challenges in the 3D reconstruction of traffic signs
         for improved inspections and maintenance. 
        We propose a hybrid approach in utilising mobile mapping and image-based data to enhance the fidelity and level of detail.
        <strong> Publication status:</strong> Under review. <strong>Co-authors:</strong> Varun Kumar Reja, Xiaofang Wen, Hamidreza Alavi, Guangming Wang</p>

      <h2>CAMHighways: The Cambridge Highways dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The CAMHighways dataset is presented, 
        built from mobile mapping data that surveyed over 40 km of UK Highways. 
        The dataset consists of textured meshes for road assets, segmented and classified point clouds,
         orthomosaics generated from pavement images, defect label annotations and shapefiles,
          and ground penetrating radar point clouds. The main aim of this work is to facilitate
           and automate the building of a Digital Twin (DT), a digital representation of the highway,
            in order to streamline inspection and maintenance through virtual reality, robotics simulation.

      <h2>Review of multimodal data and their applications for road maintenance</h2>
      <p>The application of multimodal data in road maintenance has attracted considerable
         attention due to its potential to enhance decision-making processes and improve infrastructure resilience.
          This paper provides a comprehensive review of the utilisation of various modalities of multimodal data
          , including LiDAR, RGB images, thermal images, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), text, audio, and some others for road maintenance tasks.

      <h2>Game-like interactive environment using BIM-based virtual reality for the timber frame self-build housing sector</h2>
      <p>BIM, gamification, and Virtual Reality applications are more often used to serve the interests of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA). This paper presents a comprehensive study to exploit these technologies' innovative approaches and capabilities. The study is specifically adopted to implement small and medium-size architectural and construction practices with a limited budget and time dedicated to visualisation creation.
