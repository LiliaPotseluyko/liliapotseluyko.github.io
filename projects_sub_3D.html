    <h2>Conservatory Visualisation</h2>
    <p>
      This conservatory visualization project was created using 3DS Max and VRay to achieve a realistic and inviting design. I utilized a range of plugins and modifiers to enhance the environment, including realistic grass and pebbles surrounding the conservatory. To bring the interior to life, I used the cloth modifier to simulate cushions, sofas, and other soft elements, ensuring a natural flow of fabric and folds. The textured curtains add warmth and realism to the windows, contributing to the overall cozy atmosphere.

    <h2>UAV Surveillance</h2>
    <p>
      This UAV Surveillance animation highlights the ongoing issue of oil theft from pipelines in the Niger Delta, where locals often tap pipelines illegally. 
      The project was built using 3DS Max and VRay, focusing on realistic modeling and textures. 
      It includes a close-up of the pipeline, a scene depicting oil theft and UAV monitoring, a detailed UAV model, and a fully modeled control room created from scratch.

    <h2>Subsea Mooring Animation</h2>
    <p>
      This subsea mooring animation was created in 3DS Max, featuring a detailed Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) modeled from online references and fully rigged for animation.
      To achieve a realistic underwater atmosphere, I incorporated light caustics and foggy water effects.
      The first image showcases a close-up of the ROV, while the second image highlights both the ROV and the mooring anchor, illustrating the critical connection between the vehicle and the subsea structure.

    <h2>Local House Practice</h2>
    <p>
      This local house practice project focused on honing my skills in modeling interiors from reference images using 3DS Max and VRay. 
      I aimed to recreate the structure and details of a traditional home with realistic lighting, materials, and decor. 
      Every element—furniture, curtains, and even books—was modeled and textured with precision. 
      This exercise deepened my understanding of how to translate real-world references into a fully realized 3D environment.
